### Simple File Uploader with Angular 

This is a frontend application of the home task for the company Flying Donkey. 

The tasks that are needed to be done:

- [x] Upload area - single for all files. Validation for invalid data should present.

- [x] View area consists of tables - one table per permitted file type. Each table must reflect: file name, file size, upload date.

- [ ] Keep in mind that the number of files can be unlimited.

- [x] Add at least two unit tests for the front-end. Tests must have positive and negative scenarios. Default tests added by angular cli will be ignored during the task evaluation.

- [x] The page should be as generic/reusable as possible

- [x] UI must have layered architecture, code must follow common style guides and development principles.
